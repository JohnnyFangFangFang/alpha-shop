# üè¨Introduction
This is a React practice from Alpha Camp in semester 3 (frontend).  
There will be a series of homeworks from this topic, so I'll keep updating through time while upscaling my skills in JSX, components, Sass, etc.

The image below shows what it will look like.

5. The project is ran successfully while seeing the following info in Terminal:

6. Open your browser, type "http://localhost:3000", then enjoy the project, and that would be entertaining if you could enjoy this React practice, lol. If you did so, please let me know.
